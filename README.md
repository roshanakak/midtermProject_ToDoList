# Task Me Later
This is a todo list app that auto-categorizes tasks as the user adds the name of a task, and it gets added into the correct list.

Tasks are categorized using API services such as those offered by Google, Wolfram Alpha, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, etc, and put as one of:

1. Film/Series (To watch)
2. Restaurants (To eat)
3. Books (To read)
4. Products (To buy)

In a case where there was a  mis-categorization or no categorization of a task, users are able to Edit/change the category to reflect what they want. Users can also mark a task as complete and/or delete a task that is no longer needed to be accomplished or task that is completed.

Users can filter tasks in categozies.

To use this app, users need to first register an account and then login to create a task, and when done, logout from the app.

## Project Setup
1. Install `psql` and set up a user for your machine
2. Run `psql` to enter the database
3. Run the code below to create a new user and database for the project:

```
CREATE ROLE labber WITH LOGIN password 'labber';
CREATE DATABASE midterm OWNER labber;
```


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
